        <p>This is a link to an old website I made a few years back. It contains some of the information I learned about HTML. It doesn't contain a whole lot of information, but it's worth checking out.</p>

        <h8>Here is a styled line. You can style an entire tag type, so I made this paragraph using the tag h8 so it wouldn't affect the rest of the website. Color: 694200, Font-Family: Arial, Font-Size: 24px</h8>
        <br>
        <h8>See, I did nothing to change the CSS code, but the code will affect all h8 tags.</h8>

        <p class = "styled-paragraph">
            Here is a styled paragraph. This time in the CSS code, I created a style that would only affect a certain class. I added this paragraph tag into the class, so even though this paragraph is styled, the others aren't. Color: 133511, Font-Family: Times New Roman
        </p>
        <p id = "id-paragraph">
            You can also use ID to stye your tags, but they can only affect one tag. You cannot have an ID that affectsmutiple tags, like class. Color: 230301, Font-Family: Cursive, Text-Align: Right
